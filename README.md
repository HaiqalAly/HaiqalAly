<h1 align="center"><b>Hello there! </b><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="32"></h1>

I'm Haiqal, a student based in Indonesia. I navigate the world of code, **currently focusing on learning API development with FastAPI and containerization using Docker.**

My public repositories mainly consist of experiments and projects where I build APIs in different programming languages. I'm not quite where I want to be yet, but I’m committed to continuous learning and improvement.

### Technology and Tools
- Python, FastAPI
- Docker, SQLAlchemy

### Outside of Code
- I love cats 🐈‍⬛
- The Witcher 3 is my favorite video game 🎮
- Currently listening to My Chemical Romance and Linkin Park 🎧
